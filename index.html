      <h2>What Does It Mean to “Swap” a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>
        Swapping a credit card can mean several things: closing one card and opening another, requesting a product change
        within the same bank, or shifting most of your spending from one card to a better fit. In every case you are
        changing the mix of rewards, fees and protections in your wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some swaps are driven by life changes – more travel, a new business, different income – while others are driven
        by product changes on the bank side, such as revised fee structures or altered reward tables.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Common Ways People Swap Cards</h2>
      <p>
        There are three broad approaches to swapping:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>• <strong>Product change:</strong> moving to another card with the same issuer, often without a new application.</li>
        <li>• <strong>New card, same ecosystem:</strong> switching to a different co-brand or reward structure while keeping a relationship with the bank.</li>
        <li>• <strong>Full switch:</strong> closing or sidelining an old card and moving to a competitor’s product.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each approach has different implications for credit checks, account age, reward currencies and annual fees.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What to Check Before You Swap</h2>
      <p>
        Before you change cards, it helps to map out your current and future spend: which categories dominate, how often
        you travel, and whether you typically revolve or pay in full. A card that looks attractive on paper may
        underperform if its bonuses do not match your real-life pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should also review timing: unwanted annual fees, upcoming statement cycles, unredeemed rewards and any
        promotional rates or welcome bonuses still in progress.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Balances, Transfers and Old Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        Swapping cards when you carry a balance raises additional questions. Balance transfer offers may temporarily
        reduce interest, but can come with transfer fees and conditions. Closing long-held cards can also shorten your
        average account age, which some credit scoring systems take into account.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, keeping an old no-fee card open while shifting primary use to a new product can preserve account
        history without adding ongoing cost.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rewards, Protections and the Hidden Trade-offs</h2>
      <p>
        Swapping into a “better” card is not only about headline earn rates. You also trade one set of perks and
        protections for another: travel insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty, lounge access, partner
        discounts and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        A structured comparison – side-by-side – helps reveal which protections you may be losing when you move from one
        card to the next, and whether the new rewards realistically offset any gaps.
