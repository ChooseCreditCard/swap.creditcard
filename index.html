          Some cards and loyalty programs let you move points or miles between ecosystems. This page
          explains how swaps work, what you gain, what you might lose – and how to think about value
          before you click “transfer”.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does It Mean to “Swap” Rewards?</h2>
      <p>
        In practice, “swapping” rewards usually means <strong>transferring points or miles</strong> from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a bank points ecosystem to an airline or hotel program, or</li>
        <li>one loyalty program to another through partnership links, or</li>
        <li>one credit card product to another within the same issuer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are not exchanging legal currency. Instead, you are moving units inside
        closed loyalty systems where the issuing bank or program sets the rules,
        rates and expiry policies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Points & Miles Swaps Typically Work</h2>
      <p>
        When you initiate a transfer, your card issuer or bank deducts points from your
        internal balance and instructs the partner program to credit their equivalent
        value using a preset <strong>transfer ratio</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transfers are often <strong>one-way</strong> — you cannot move them back.</li>
        <li>Ratios can be 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 or more, depending on partnership.</li>
        <li>Transfers may be immediate or take several days to complete.</li>
        <li>Once in the partner program, <strong>expiry rules</strong> may change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Swaps within the same bank (for example, product changes that consolidate points)
        are usually handled internally and may not involve external partners, but still
        follow internal transfer rules.
      </p>

    <!-- Value & risks -->
    <section id="value" class="section">
      <h2>When Swapping Rewards Adds Value – and When It Destroys It</h2>
      <p>
        The key question is whether the <strong>real-world value per point</strong> improves
        after the swap. A worse headline ratio can still be good if redemption value is higher.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Potential reasons to swap</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You see a redemption you will actually use (flight, hotel, upgrade).</li>
        <li>The partner program offers clearly higher value per point for your trip.</li>
        <li>You are topping up an existing balance to reach a specific award.</li>
        <li>There is a temporary transfer bonus that increases effective value.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Risks and trade-offs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Transfers are often final – no way to move points back.</li>
        <li>Devaluations and award chart changes can arrive with short notice.</li>
        <li>Fees, surcharges or taxes on redemptions can eat into value.</li>
        <li>
          Expiry rules may become stricter once points sit in a partner program
          instead of a flexible bank pool.
        </li>
      </ul>
